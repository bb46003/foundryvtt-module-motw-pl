    <p>You&rsquo;re employed, with a regular pay check and little or no
    oversight. As long as you send in a story every few days, no matter how
    bizarre, you&rsquo;re set. Every now and again they&rsquo;ll send you
    somewhere in particular, and when that happens it usually involves
    supernatural activity. Unless they need human interest, in which case it
    will be a kitten show or agricultural fair or something.</p>
