    <p>You have a few attack spells you can use as weapons.&nbsp;When you use
    these spells to&nbsp;<strong>kick some ass</strong>, roll
    +Weird&nbsp;instead of +Tough.</p>

    <p>Sometimes the situation may require&nbsp;you to&nbsp;<strong>act under
    pressure</strong>&nbsp;to cast your spell without&nbsp;problems.</p>

    <p>Your combat spells can combine any of your base spells&nbsp;with any of
    your effects.</p>

        <p><strong>On a 10+</strong>, choose one extra effect:</p>

        <ul>

        <li>You gain the advantage: take +1 forward, or give +1 forward to
        another hunter.</li>

        <li>You inflict terrible harm (+1 harm).</li>

        <li>You suffer less harm (-1 harm).</li>

        <li>You force them where you want them.</li>

        </ul>

        <p><br><strong>ADVANCED: On a 12+</strong>&nbsp;instead pick an enhanced
        effect:</p>

        <ul>

        <li>You completely hold the advantage.&nbsp;All hunters involved in the
        fight get +1 forward.</li>

        <li>You suffer no harm at all.</li>

        <li>Your attack inflicts double the normal harm.</li>

        <li>Your attack drives the enemy away in a rout.</li>

      value: >-
        <p><strong>On a 7+</strong>, you and whatever you&rsquo;re fighting
        inflict harm on each other. The amount of harm is based on the
        established dangers in the game. That usually means you inflict the harm
        rating of your weapon and your enemy inflicts their attack&rsquo;s harm
        rating on you.</p>

      key: system.moveResults.failure.value

      value: >-
        <p><strong>On a miss</strong>, you get your ass kicked instead. You
        suffer harm or get captured, but don&rsquo;t inflict any harm back.</p>
