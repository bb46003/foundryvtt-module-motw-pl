      value: >-
        <p><strong>For a normal person:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>On a 10+</strong>, then they&rsquo;ll do it for the reason
        you gave them. If you asked too much, they&rsquo;ll tell you the minimum
        it would take for them to do it (or if there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;d
        do it).<br /><br /><strong>ADVANCED: On a 12+</strong> not only do they
        do what you want right now, they also become your <strong>ally
        </strong>for the rest of the mystery (or, if you do enough for them,
        permanently).<br /><br /><strong>For another hunter: </strong></p>

        <p><strong>On a 10+</strong>, if they do what you ask they mark
        experience and get +1 forward.<br /><br /><strong>ADVANCED: On a
        12+</strong> they must act under pressure to resist your request. If
        they do what you ask, they mark one experience and take +1 ongoing while
        doing what you asked.</p>

      key: data.moveResults.partial.value
      label: Partial success
      value: >-
        <p><strong>For a normal person:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>On a 7-9</strong>, they&rsquo;ll do it, but only if you do
        something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you asked too
        much, they&rsquo;ll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them
        to do it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>For another hunter:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>On a 7-9</strong>, they mark experience if they do what you
        ask.&nbsp;</p>
    failure:
      key: data.moveResults.failure.value
      label: Miss...
      value: >-
        <p><strong>For a normal person:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>On a miss, </strong>your approach is completely wrong: you
        offend or anger the target.<br /><br /><strong>For another
        hunter:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>On a miss</strong>, it&rsquo;s up to that hunter to decide
        how badly you offend or annoy them. They mark experience if they decide
        not to do what you asked.&nbsp;</p>
