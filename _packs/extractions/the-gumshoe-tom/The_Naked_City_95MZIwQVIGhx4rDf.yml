    <p>You have lots of <strong>personal contacts</strong> wherever you go. Pick
    four contact types from the below areas (or from other areas agreed to
    between you and the Keeper).</p>

    <p>You can hit them up for info (+1 to one investigate a mystery roll) or
    small favours&mdash;but there may be a small cost involved. Personal
    contacts can provide more significant help but the Keeper decides their
    price on a case-by-case basis.</p>
