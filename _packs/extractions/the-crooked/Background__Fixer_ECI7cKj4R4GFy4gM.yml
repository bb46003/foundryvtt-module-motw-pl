    <p>If you <strong>need to buy something, sell something, or hire
    someone</strong>, roll +Charm. On a 10+ you know just the person who will be
    interested. On a 7-9 you know the only person who can do it, but
    there&rsquo;s a complication. Pick one: you owe them; they screwed you over;
    you screwed them over. On a miss, the only person who can help is someone
    who absolutely hates you.</p>
