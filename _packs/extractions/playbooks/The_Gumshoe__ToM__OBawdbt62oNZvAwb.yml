You’ve got to pay for what you’ve done, sweetheart, whatever it is I might feel about you. Yes, I’ll have some bad nights, but I’ll still have myself.</em></p>\n<p>\_</p>\n</blockquote>\n<table style=\"width:100%;border-width:1px\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width:45.9724%\"></col><col style=\"width:54.0276%\"></col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:127px\">\n<td style=\"height:127px;border-width:1px\" colspan=\"2\">\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>To make your Gumshoe, first pick a name. Then follow the instructions in this playbook to decide your look, ratings, code, moves, and gear. Finally, introduce yourself and pick history.<br /><br /><em><strong>Instructions</strong>: @UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.t3YADGEDM63gagJf]{Items}\_ can be dragged and dropped to the appropriate header/field. For other values and descriptions, you need to copy and paste, or manually change them.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;border-width:1px\">\n<h3>Look</h3>\n<p>Pick one from each list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Angelic face, unshaven face, handsomely devilish face, world-weary face, sly face, streetwise face, quiet face, knowing face, watchful face, merry face, obvious ex-cop face, hunted face</li>\n<li>Nondescript clothes, tailored clothes and sunglasses, vintage clothes, fashion clothes, fedora and trench coat, California casual, biker clothes, Pacific island casual clothes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br />Ratings</h3>\n<p>Pick one line:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird=0</li>\n<li>Charm+2, Cool=0, Sharp+1, Tough+1, Weird–1</li>\n<li>Charm+1, Cool=0, Sharp+2, Tough+1, Weird–1</li>\n<li>Charm+1, Cool–1, Sharp+2, Tough=0, Weird=+1</li>\n<li>Charm+2, Cool+1, Sharp+1, Tough=0, Weird–1</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><br />Gumshoe Code</h3>\n<p>With the agreement of the Keeper, pick a one-sentence Code that your Gumshoe adheres to.</p>\n<p><em>(Foundry: Add the @UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.SDVlTHGdXYPP2IX2]{Gumshoe Code} move to your character sheet, open it for editing, and type in your code).</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Example Codes:</strong> Murders must be punished. Monsters must be destroyed. Innocents must be saved. Laws must be enforced. Evil must be exposed. The weak must be protected from the powerful.</em></p>\n<p>This Code defines your Gumshoe. Any time you violate your code you forfeit all Code related moves (<strong>The Postman Always Rings Twice</strong>, <strong>The Long Goodbye</strong>) and the ability to spend Luck points. These forfeits last either until the next mystery or you make amends.</p>\n<p>As long as you follow the Code people will sense your sincerity: you receive +1 ongoing for <strong>manipulate someone</strong> and you may not be possessed or charmed by any sort of supernatural, alien, or demonic entity or item.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Moves</h3>\n<p>You get all Basic moves and three Gumshoe moves. You get these two:</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.ojz2KkHKyHsUNVea]{Occult Confidential}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.95MZIwQVIGhx4rDf]{The Naked City}</p>\n<p>Then pick one of these:</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.M3t6KUpN6t6QtQMJ]{\"Just one more thing\"}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.t3YADGEDM63gagJf]{Asphalt Jungle}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.lmqe39tv3JZU5Pib]{Hacker with a Dragon Tattoo}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.MQmLwn1cK2buyCB8]{Jessica Jones Entry}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.ojz2KkHKyHsUNVea]{Occult Confidential}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.qlOUXlpO7jvV1bYL]{Out of the Past}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.U1vB14499b8OugcP]{The Long Goodbye}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.motw-for-pbta.the-gumshoe-tom.Item.Q8Nj8CPAva528Dvw]{The Postman Always Rings Twice}</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;border-width:1px\">\n<h3>Gear</h3>\n<p>You get a laptop, a liquor flask, two recording devices, and one P.I. weapon (Please note that you, or your Keeper must create these manually).</p>\n<h4><br />Recording devices (<em>pick two</em>):</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Night vision camera</li>\n<li>Tiny digital video camera</li>\n<li>Film camera (8mm or 16mm)</li>\n<li>Digital sound recorder</li>\n<li>Cassette tape recorder</li>\n<li>Remote-controlled camera drone</li>\n<li>Laser microphone</li>\n<li>SLR camera</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><br />P.I.

On your turn, introduce your Gumshoe by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.</p>\n<h3><br />History</h3>\n<p>Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are on the same (or rival) bowling teams. Ask them what bowling-related disagreement rubbed them the wrong way.</li>\n<li>You caught them committing a crime but let them go. Ask them to describe the crime, then you explain why your Code required you to look the other way.</li>\n<li>They remind you of a former partner who was mysteriously murdered. Describe the unsolved case that killed your partner and how you hope to solve it.</li>\n<li>You first approached them for help on a case. Describe the case. Ask them to describe the key expertise they provided that solved that mystery.</li>\n<li>You were friends back in training, before you became a private investigator. This could be military, law enforcement, or whatever - decide the details between you.</li>\n<li>Ask them if they live by a code and what it is. If you approve of the code, you’ve always respected them. If not (or if they don’t have a code), you’ve never trusted them.</li>\n<li>They hired you for a job but you were too drunk or high to take it. Ask them what they wanted, then tell them how you brushed them off.</li>\n<li>You first met on an unsolved crimes website. Decide together what infamous crime fascinates you both.</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"height:17px;border-width:1px\" colspan=\"2\">\_<br />\n<h2>Leveling Up</h2>\n<p><em>On the Character Sheet, open either Improvements or Advanced Improvements for editing.
