Ask them why.</li>\n<li>They keep you grounded, and are unfazed by your displays of power.</li>\n<li>You were part of the same cult, sect, or secret society.

Write down in detail what the spell does, and what it requires. You know how to cast it off the top of your head, and you choose two requirements from this list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Magic words and ritual gestures.</li>\n<li>An object of power (wand, talisman, orb, staff, etc) which must be wielded.</li>\n<li>An expendable component such as sulfur, sage, or incense, which must be burned, blown, or scattered during the casting.</li>\n<li>Runes or symbols written or engraved on a surface (which must be prepared).</li>\n<li>A spilling of blood, which inflicts 1-harm upon you or a willing participant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Give your new rote a name, and decide specifically what the requirements are (which words, gestures, objects, symbols, and procedures are required). Unlike regular <strong>use magic</strong>, a rote’s cost and the consequences for failing it are known to you in advance. After you cast it for the first time, treat each rote as a custom move—a specialised version of use magic, which is built with the Keeper. Write down what it does on a 10+, a 7-9, and a miss. Also, a rote is a bit more powerful than a basic use magic spell: its glitches are less onerous and its effect may be a little bigger.</p>\n<p>Casting a rote requires you to have the needed items at hand and the ability to physically use them. You roll +Weird to cast it, as you would when <strong>using magic</strong> normally.</p>\n<h3>How many rotes?</h3>\n<p>You start out knowing up to one rote, which you can choose when creating your character or during play. You can learn more by taking improvements—when you do, you can choose the new rote right away or in play.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
