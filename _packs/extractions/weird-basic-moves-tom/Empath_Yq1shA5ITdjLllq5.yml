    <p>When you <strong>open up your brain to feel the emotions</strong> of
    something right there in front of you, roll +Weird.</p>

    <p>You can use empath on anything with emotions (e.g. animals and some
    monsters), but the less human they are, the less itâ€™s safe for you. If the
    emotions are especially strong or alien, you might need to act under
    pressure regardless of how successful your roll was.</p>
