  description: >-
    <p>You have a (most likely intimate) <strong>connection to some supernatural
    being</strong> who is your guide into the world beyond. Choose if your
    relationship is secret or not.</p>

    <p>Determine what kind of creature your Guide is and how your relationship
    works. Say what kind of power they possess. The Keeper will decide how it
    works and define your Guide as a threat.</p>

    <p>If your Guide is another hunter, determine together how your relationship
    works.</p>

    <p>Whenever you would roll +Weird you can roll +Charm instead, by channeling
    the power of your bond. When you do so and miss, in addition to the usual
    consequences, you and your Guide suffer as when you miss a roll for
    <strong>bond abuse</strong>.</p>
