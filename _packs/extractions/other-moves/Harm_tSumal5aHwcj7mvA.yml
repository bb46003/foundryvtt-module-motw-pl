  description: >-
    <p>Whenever you suffer harm, the Keeper will tell you what effect it has.
    Injury severity depends on how much harm you have suffered:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>0-harm wounds have only minor, short term effects.</li>

    <li>4-7 harm wounds are serious and unstable. They will get worse unless
    treated. Mark the &ldquo;Unstable&rdquo; box.</li>

    <li>8-harm or more will kill a normal human, including a hunter.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Armour reduces the harm suffered by the number of points it is rated
    for.</p>

    <p>Monsters may not be defeated until you use their weakness against them,
    and this applies to some minions as well.</p>
