  description: >-
    <p>You become a terrifying fount of mystical power. Once per mystery, after
    you suffer loss or harm, you may enter a state where you have both immense
    power and zero interest in the well-being of other people. While in this
    state, you can fly, use +Weird to <strong>kick some ass</strong> instead of
    +Tough (using innate magic as a 3-harm weapon with whatever properties you
    choose), ignore the component costs of your rotes, ignore one requirement of
    every spell you cast with <strong>use magic</strong>, and you have +1
    ongoing to do everything.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, you outright cannot use the<strong> protect
    someone</strong> move, you have all the Temptations, and you have to indulge
    them whenever a good opportunity presents itself. When you try to resist a
    temptation, roll +Cool. On a 10+, your apotheosis ends. On a 7-9, it ends
    with you doing something dangerous or cruel. On a miss, it ends only after
    you harm someone (or something) you love.</p>
