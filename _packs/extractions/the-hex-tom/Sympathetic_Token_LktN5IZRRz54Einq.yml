    <p>As long as you carry a personal object belonging to someone, such as a
    lock of hair, a full set of toenails, or a treasured family heirloom, you
    get +1 ongoing to <strong>use magic</strong> against them.</p>

    <p>You can also <strong>use magic</strong> against them at a distance.</p>

    <p>If you try to <strong>use magic</strong> against them and miss, the token
    is lost, destroyed, or loses its power.</p>
