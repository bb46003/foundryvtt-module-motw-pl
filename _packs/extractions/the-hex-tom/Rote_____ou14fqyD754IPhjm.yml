  description: >-
    <p>Whenever you <strong>use magic</strong>, you can decide afterwards that a
    particular spell is a rote that you know. Write down in detail what the
    spell does, and what it requires. You know how to cast it off the top of
    your head, and you choose two requirements from the below list.</p>

    <p>Give your new rote a name, and decide specifically what the requirements
    are.</p>

    <p><em>(Foundry: Replace this description with the description of your Rote.
    This move can be used several times, as you gain new Rotes).</em></p>
